My goal is to help organizations with my skills, experience and ability to learn.\r\n\r\n``` Java\r\n@Override\r\n    public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {\r\n        // Inflate the menu; this adds items to the action bar if it is present.\r\n        getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.menu_main, menu);\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## H2 Line ABCD\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### H3 Line abcde with links\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. \r\n[GitHub](http://github.com)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
